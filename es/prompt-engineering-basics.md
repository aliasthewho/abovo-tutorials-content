# Introduction

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective instructions to guide large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Mastering this skill enables developers, researchers, and knowledge workers to get precise, safe, and efficient outputs from AI systems.

This tutorial is based on practical lessons from:
- [DeepLearning.AI: ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/chatgpt-prompt-eng/)
- [Anthropic: Real World Prompting](https://github.com/anthropics/courses/blob/master/real_world_prompting/README.md)

## What is a Prompt?

A prompt is any input given to an AI model to elicit a response. Prompts may include questions, commands, examples, or context. The structure and clarity of the prompt have a major impact on model output.

## Prompt Design Patterns

### 1. Instruction-based prompts

> “Summarize the following text in bullet points…”

Use concise directives to clearly state your goal.

### 2. Zero-shot and Few-shot prompting

- **Zero-shot**: Provide only a task.
- **Few-shot**: Include examples to guide the model’s behavior.

### 3. Role prompting

> “You are a financial advisor. Explain diversification to a beginner.”

Assigning roles helps models align with expectations and tone.

### 4. Chain of Thought prompting

Encourages step-by-step reasoning.

> “Let’s think step by step…”

### 5. Format enforcement

> “Reply in valid JSON with keys: 'title', 'summary', 'tags'.”

Use structural hints to receive output suitable for parsing or post-processing.

## Common Pitfalls

- Vague instructions
- Overloading the prompt with unrelated context
- Relying on implicit goals
- Forgetting language neutrality or user audience

## Examples and Use Cases

Examples are drawn from:
- AI content generation
- Software development assistants
- Code refactoring
- Business analysis and report drafting
- Recipe and instruction generation (see Windsurf examples)

## Summary

Effective prompts are a key interface between humans and modern AI systems. Good prompts make AI tools useful, safe, and controllable — and poor prompts result in inefficiency and risk. Learn to think like a prompt engineer, and your productivity with AI will accelerate.
